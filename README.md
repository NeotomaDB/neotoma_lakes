# Neotoma Lake Matches

The Neotoma Paleoecology Database contains a number of sites obtained from lakes in North America.  The development of National Hydrographic Databases in Canada and in the United States allows us to link records in Neotoma to records within the constituent databases.  These links allow Neotoma users to obtain information about lake size, catchment area and additional information, including a link to the national hydrographic database.

In addition, through the process of examining the lake databases it is clear that a number of records within Neotoma have coordinates that are either inaccurate due to rounding, or have been entered incorrectly.  Because Neotoma uses decimal degrees it is often possible to assume that precision is higher than it actually is.

## Workflow

Download the lake data from the National Hydrography Data resources, check lakes in Neotoma against the lakes in the NHDs. Any lakes with exact matches get added to a table of records.
